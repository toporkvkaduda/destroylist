🚨 Key Info for Online Fraud Victims 🚨
Destroylist aims to disable malicious domains, targeting scams, phishing, and illicit sites to enhance internet safety.
Before adding a domain, we:

Scan it across cybersecurity platforms for threat intelligence.
Send a complaint to the registrar and host (via WHOIS), including scan results, domain screenshots, and a request to investigate their client, notifying them of our public database entry.

Per ICANN rules, registrars must review complaints within 24 hours.
If scammed by a listed domain, check its addition date via commit history, Telegram, or Mastodon. If fraud occurred after listing, the registrar or host’s delay may share responsibility for your loss. They could assist you or your legal team.
